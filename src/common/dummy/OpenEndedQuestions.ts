      question:
        'What are the different types of cache memories and how do they improve system performance?',
      answer:
        'Cache memories include L1, L2, and sometimes L3 caches. They improve system performance by storing frequently used data closer to the processor to reduce access time.'
    },
    {
      question:
        'Explain the role of the CPU in a computer system and its major components.',
      answer:
        'The CPU, or central processing unit, is the brain of the computer. Its major components include the control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers. The CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions, performing the core processing tasks.'
    },
    {
      question:
        'How does pipelining in processor design help to increase the execution speed?',
      answer:
        'Pipelining allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages of the pipeline. This overlapping of instructions increases the throughput and execution speed of the processor.'
    },
    {
      question:
        'Discuss the significance of instruction set architecture (ISA) in computer systems.',
      answer:
        'The ISA defines the set of basic instructions that a processor can execute. It is significant as it determines the capabilities of the processor, affects the design of both hardware and software, and is crucial for compatibility and performance.'
    },
    {
      question:
        'Why is virtual memory important in modern computer systems and how does it work?',
      answer:
        'Virtual memory allows systems to use more memory than is physically available by using disk space as an extension of RAM. It works by swapping out less frequently used pages of memory to disk, thus allowing more programs to run concurrently.'
